COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

Project Overview

This Power BI report provides an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data, covering global and regional trends in case numbers, recovery and mortality rates, as well as day-wise reporting on new cases, deaths, and recoveries. Interactive features, including buttons and bookmarks, allow users to explore data by region and time period, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic’s global impact.

Insightful Analysis

1. Dashboard Overview

Observation: The dashboard presents total cases, recovery rate, mortality rate, and monthly cases, with additional insights into confirmed cases by region.

Insight: By tracking monthly case trends, the dashboard highlights periods of significant increases or decreases in cases, which may correspond to global events or policy changes. The recovery and mortality rates provide a quick understanding of the pandemic’s impact on health outcomes over time, showing improvements as healthcare responses evolved.


2. Regional Analysis

Observation: The analysis includes the top 10 countries most affected by COVID-19 and cases confirmed under WHO, providing insights into the countries with the highest infection rates.

Insight: Focusing on the top 10 affected countries reveals specific geographic areas with high infection rates, potentially due to factors like high population density, international travel, or healthcare infrastructure. Comparing this with WHO-confirmed cases provides a global context, helping to assess the scale and reach of COVID-19 across different regions.


3. COVID-19 Cases Based on Every Country

Observation: This section breaks down confirmed COVID-19 cases by individual country, enabling a granular view of the pandemic’s global spread.

Insight: Viewing data by country helps identify unique national patterns, such as rapid case escalation in specific regions or notable differences in case handling. This insight is critical for understanding the diverse approaches countries have taken and evaluating which practices were most effective in controlling the virus.


4. Day-Wise Report on New Cases, Deaths, and Recoveries

Observation: The day-wise reporting includes new cases, deaths, and recoveries, which allows for detailed trend analysis over time.

Insight: This breakdown shows daily fluctuations, enabling us to pinpoint exact dates with high spikes in cases or deaths. These trends can correspond to specific events, policy changes, or seasonal impacts, providing valuable insights into how the pandemic evolved day by day. Tracking recoveries day-by-day also highlights healthcare improvements and the effects of medical interventions.
